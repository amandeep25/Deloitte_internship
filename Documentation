"I hear and I forget.
    I see and I remember.
       I do and I understand."
                            - Confucius
This methodology dates back to centuries, yet is applicable to date. Success comes to those who at least try and improve on their
shortcomings. 

I express my gratitude to the Deloitte and InsideSherpa team for giving me this opportunity to "learn by doing".
I am Amandeep Kaur,pursuing Bachelor's in Technology from IGDTUW,India.

I appreciate the vitual internship initiative by the team as it provides an insight to the working experience in the corporate world.

I hereby share my experience for the same :

The internship had various modules that corresponded with the business strategy followed by the organisation.

In the Technology strategy and Innovation module, problem statement was to design a software for online banking.
Through this module, I learnt how to define a project approach by analysing the advantages and the consequences of 
technology aspects before developing an approach.
The module taught how to Design a business case which reflected the overview of costs,benefits and considerations and finally developing an 
implementation plan for the same.


Optimization and Delivery Module was more related to finance and strategy planning for delivering the accounting software for the the firm SectorMetric.
Market scan was conducted to analyze the potential solutions on various services and capabilities and vendors were shortlisted.
Through the RSP module, I learnt to estimate the cost for vendors through past experinece in the market  and designed an implementation plan 
giving details of the milestones achieved throughout the 6 weeks.

The last module introduced the concept of cloud computing.
The problem statement was that a large Australian University planned its IT portfolio spend over next 5 years, making coud a potential 
option for the same.

Task 1 introduced me to the application of cloud computing in real life scenarios.I was able to analyse the benefits a cloud based model 
would offer to an University.
The risks and considerations are to be taken account of while making a transition from a traditional to a cloud-based model.
Through the Cloud Readiness Assessment, I was able to dtermine wheather an apllication would be suitable for cloud or not based upon
various factors like data secuity,customization,dependencies etc.

At each level,the model work prepared by Deloitte team helped me understand and improve my submission.

Thanks to Deloitte and InsideSherpa team, I had an enriching and knowledgeful experience.
