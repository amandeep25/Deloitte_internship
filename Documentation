"I hear and I forget.
    I see and I remember.
       I do and I understand."
                            - Confucius
This methodology dates back to centuries, yet is applicable to date. Success comes to those who at least try and improve on their
shortcomings. 

I express my gratitude to the Deloitte and InsideSherpa team for giving me this opportunity to "learn by doing".
I am Amandeep Kaur,pursuing Bachelor's in Technology from IGDTUW,India.

I appreciate the vitual internship initiative by the team as it provides an insight to the working experience in the corporate world.

I hereby share my experience for the same :

The internship had various modules that corresponded with the business strategy followed by the organisation.

In the Technology strategy and Innovation module, problem statement was to design a software for online banking.
Through this module, I learnt how to define a project approach by analysing the advantages and the consequences of 
technology aspects before developing an approach.
The module taught how to Design a business case which reflected the overview of costs,benefits and considerations and finally developing an 
implementation plan for the same.

Through the RSP module, I learnt to estimate the cost for vendors through past experinece in the market  and designed an implementation plan
